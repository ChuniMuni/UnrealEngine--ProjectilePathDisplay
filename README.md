A blueprint module for visualizing projectile trajectory in Unreal Engine v4.20.

## Projectile Path Display Basics:
- The BP_ProjectilePathDisplay actor contains the core logic for visualizing the projectile trajectories. Add it as child actor to your weapons and call the Activate/Deactivate Module events to control the path display system.
- The predicted projectile paths are visualized through instanced static meshes while decals are used to visualize the impact location.
